## Test Coverage Analysis

### Operational Principle Tests
- **User Registration**: Tests user account creation with validation
- **Saved Places Management**: Tests adding, removing, and retrieving saved places
- **Preferences Management**: Tests updating and retrieving user preferences
- **User Isolation**: Tests that users maintain independent state

### Interesting Scenarios Tested
1. **Registration Validation**: Tests required field validation and duplicate prevention
2. **Duplicate Handling**: Tests that saving the same place twice doesn't create duplicates
3. **Error Handling**: Tests error conditions for non-existent users and places
4. **Preferences Updates**: Tests complete preferences replacement
5. **State Isolation**: Tests that users maintain independent saved places and preferences
6. **Edge Cases**: Tests scenarios with empty saved places and missing users

### Key Features Validated
- ✅ User registration with validation
- ✅ Duplicate user prevention
- ✅ Saved places management (add, remove, retrieve)
- ✅ Duplicate place prevention
- ✅ Preferences management
- ✅ User state isolation
- ✅ Error handling for non-existent users
- ✅ Database persistence and async operations

## Performance Notes
- All tests completed successfully with proper database cleanup
- User state isolation is properly maintained
- Database operations are efficiently managed
- Error handling provides clear feedback for invalid operations
