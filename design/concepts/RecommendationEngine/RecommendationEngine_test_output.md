## Test Coverage Analysis

### Operational Principle Tests
- **Recommendation Caching**: Tests computation and caching of recommendations
- **Refresh Logic**: Tests recommendation updates when user behavior changes
- **Stale Data Handling**: Tests fresh computation when recommendations are stale
- **Data Cleanup**: Tests clearing recommendations and timestamps

### Interesting Scenarios Tested
1. **Initial State**: Tests empty recommendation state
2. **Caching Behavior**: Tests recommendation computation and caching with 24-hour refresh interval
3. **Refresh Logic**: Tests recommendation updates when user behavior changes
4. **Stale Data Handling**: Tests fresh computation when cached data is older than refresh interval
5. **Data Cleanup**: Tests complete removal of recommendation data

### Key Features Validated
- ✅ Recommendation computation and caching
- ✅ 24-hour refresh interval handling
- ✅ Fresh computation for stale data
- ✅ User behavior change detection
- ✅ Data cleanup and removal
- ✅ Database persistence and async operations

## Performance Notes
- All tests completed successfully with proper database cleanup
- Caching mechanism works correctly with timestamp management
- Recommendation algorithm handles various user scenarios
- Database operations are efficiently managed with proper cleanup
