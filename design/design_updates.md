# Design Updates: Changes to Design

## Overview
This document summarizes the major architectural and design changes made to the matchamatch backend during implementation. For detailed interesting moments and implementation challenges, see [design_changes.md](./design_changes.md).

## Database Integration Refactoring
**Change**: Converted all concepts from in-memory data structures to MongoDB persistence.
**Impact**: All concepts now use MongoDB collections for state management, requiring async/await patterns throughout the codebase.
**Files affected**: All concept implementation files in `src/concepts/`

## Type Safety Improvements
**Change**: Implemented proper ID type branding and resolved TypeScript compilation issues.
**Impact**: Better type safety and reduced runtime errors.
**Files affected**: Type definitions and tests (see `src/utils/types.ts` and concept tests)

### Inter-Concept Communication
**Impact**: Automated recommendation updates across concept boundaries

Implemented five synchronization patterns to maintain consistency:

1. **PlaceCreationSync**: New places become available for saving
2. **SavedPlaceRecommendationSync**: Saved places trigger recommendation refresh
3. **PreferenceRecommendationSync**: Preference updates trigger recommendations
4. **ExperienceRecommendationSync**: New experience logs trigger recommendations
5. **GlobalPlaceRecommendationSync**: New places refresh all user recommendations


## Error Handling Standardization

### Unified Error Response Pattern
**Impact**: Consistent error handling across all concepts

- **Pattern**: Methods return `T | {error: string}` instead of throwing exceptions
- **Benefits**: 
  - More predictable API behavior
  - Better error messages for clients
  - Easier testing and debugging
- **Affected Concepts**: PlaceDirectory, UserDirectory, RecommendationEngine

## Testing Infrastructure

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
**Impact**: Reliable test suite with proper isolation

**Improvements**:
- Database connection lifecycle management (try-finally blocks)
- Test data isolation and cleanup
- Mock implementations for external dependencies (LLM)
- Principle-based testing for core functionality

## Concept-Specific Enhancements

### ExperienceLog
- Added `sweetness` and `strength` parameters to `create_log`
- New action: `get_tried_places` (moved from UserDirectory for modularity)
- Added `delete_log` capability
- AI-powered profile summary generation with validation

### PlaceDirectory
- Simplified geospatial queries (removed MongoDB geospatial index requirement)
- Implemented custom distance calculation for `find_nearby`
- Enhanced search with multiple criteria

### UserDirectory
- Preference management system
- Saved places tracking
- Profile retrieval with aggregated data

### RecommendationEngine
- Scoring algorithm considering:
  - User preferences (sweetness, strength)
  - Place ratings and popularity
  - Distance from user location
  - Saved vs. tried places
- Automatic refresh triggers via synchronizations
