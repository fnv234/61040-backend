# RecommendationEngine Test Execution Output

## Test Results Summary

* **Total Tests**: 1 test suite
* **Total Steps**: 5 steps
* **Status**: All tests passed ✅
* **Execution Time**: ~1 second

## Detailed Test Output

```
running 1 test from ./src/concepts/RecommendationEngine/RecommendationEngineConcept.test.ts
RecommendationEngine ...
  initial state: no recommendations ... ok (16ms)
  principle: recommendations are computed and cached ... ok (146ms)
  principle: recommendations refresh when user behavior changes warrant ... ok (71ms)
  get_recommendations fetches fresh if stale ... ok (93ms)
  clear_recommendations removes user data ... ok (136ms)
RecommendationEngine ... ok (948ms)
```

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Operational Principle Tests

* **Recommendation Caching**: Tests computation and caching of recommendations
* **Refresh Logic**: Tests recommendation updates when user behavior changes
* **Stale Data Handling**: Tests fresh computation when recommendations are stale
* **Data Cleanup**: Tests clearing recommendations and timestamps

### Interesting Scenarios Tested

1. **Initial State**: Tests empty recommendation state
2. **Caching Behavior**: Tests recommendation computation and caching with 24-hour refresh interval
3. **Refresh Logic**: Tests recommendation updates when user behavior changes
4. **Stale Data Handling**: Tests fresh computation when cached data is older than refresh interval
5. **Data Cleanup**: Tests complete removal of recommendation data

### Key Features Validated

* ✅ Recommendation computation and caching
* ✅ 24-hour refresh interval handling
* ✅ Fresh computation for stale data
* ✅ User behavior change detection
* ✅ Data cleanup and removal
* ✅ Database persistence and async operations
