## Test Coverage Analysis

### Operational Principle Tests

* **Create, Update, Delete Logs**: Tests the core CRUD operations for log entries
* **Getters and Queries**: Tests all query methods for retrieving log data
* **AI Profile Summary**: Tests the AI-augmented action for generating user profiles

### Interesting Scenarios Tested

1. **Validation Testing**: Tests all input validation (rating, sweetness, strength ranges)
2. **Error Handling**: Tests error conditions for non-existent logs and invalid inputs
3. **Data Integrity**: Tests unique place tracking and average calculations
4. **AI Integration**: Tests LLM integration with validation and error handling
5. **Edge Cases**: Tests scenarios with no logs, validation failures, and mock responses

### Key Features Validated

* ✅ Log creation with proper validation
* ✅ Log updates and deletions
* ✅ User log retrieval and filtering
* ✅ Place-based log queries
* ✅ Average rating calculations
* ✅ Unique place tracking
* ✅ AI profile summary generation
* ✅ LLM validation and error handling
* ✅ Database persistence and async operations
