# trace: ExperienceLog

The trace below demonstrates how the `ExperienceLog` concept fulfills its principle by allowing users to log their experiences at places and then generating an AI-powered summary of their preferences.

## Trace: Creating and Summarizing User Logs

1. **User creates a log for a place:**
   * `user-1` visits `place-a`.
   * They create a log entry: `create_log(userId: "user-1", placeId: "place-a", rating: 5, sweetness: 5, strength: 5, notes: "Loved it!")`.
   * The system records this log with a timestamp.

2. **User creates another log for a different place:**
   * `user-1` visits `place-b`.
   * They create a log entry: `create_log(userId: "user-1", placeId: "place-b", rating: 4, sweetness: 3, strength: 4, notes: "Good, but could be sweeter.")`.
   * The system records this log.

3. **User creates a third log for the same first place, with different characteristics:**
   * `user-1` visits `place-a` again.
   * They create another log entry: `create_log(userId: "user-1", placeId: "place-a", rating: 3, sweetness: 3, strength: 3, notes: "A bit too bitter.")`.
   * The system records this log.

4. **User requests a profile summary:**
   * `user-1` requests a summary of their matcha tasting preferences.
   * The `generate_profile_summary` action is called with `userId: "user-1"` and a mock `GeminiLLM`.

5. **AI Model processes the logs:**
   * The `generate_profile_summary` action retrieves all logs for `user-1` from the `Logs` set. This includes the three logs created above.
   * It calculates average rating (4.0), average sweetness (3.7), average strength (4.0), and identifies the unique places tried (`place-a`, `place-b`).
   * It also identifies recent logs for context.
   * This information is formatted into a prompt and sent to the `GeminiLLM`.

6. **AI Model generates a summary:**
   * The `GeminiLLM` processes the prompt and generates a summary based on the provided data and guidelines. A sample response: "You generally prefer sweeter and stronger matcha, with a slight tendency towards higher ratings. Your experiences at places like 'place-a' have been mixed, while 'place-b' was consistently enjoyed."

7. **Validation and Return:**
   * The generated summary is validated against the user's logs (e.g., ensuring it only mentions places tried and aligns with the sentiment).
   * The validated summary is returned to the user.

This trace demonstrates how individual logs are captured and how, through an AI-powered action, these logs are synthesized into meaningful insights about the user's preferences, fulfilling the concept's purpose and principle.
