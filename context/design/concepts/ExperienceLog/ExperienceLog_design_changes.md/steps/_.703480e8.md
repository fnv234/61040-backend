# ExperienceLog Concept Design Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to the ExperienceLog concept during implementation and testing.

## Major Changes

Firstly, create\_log now also initializes sweetness and strength at creation, as required in feedback on Assignment 2. I also added the get\_tried\_places action to ExperienceLog based on this feedback instead of in UserDirectory to maintain modularity. I additionally included a way to delete logs. Next, I will go into more detail about other changes/notes:

### 1. Database Integration

**Original Design**: Used in-memory `Map<string, Log>` for storage
**Implementation**: Converted to MongoDB `Collection<Log>` with proper async/await patterns

**Changes Made**:

* Changed `private logs: Map<string, Log> = new Map();` to `private logs: Collection<Log>;`
* Added MongoDB collection initialization in constructor
* Made all methods async to handle database operations
* Added proper error handling for database operations

### 2. Log Structure Updates

**Original Design**: Used `logId` as a simple string identifier
**Implementation**: Added MongoDB document structure with `_id` field

**Changes Made**:

* Updated `Log` interface to include `_id: LogId`
* Modified all methods to use `_id` instead of `logId`
* Updated tests to use `log._id` instead of `log.logId`

### 3. AI Integration Enhancement

**Original Design**: Basic LLM integration for profile summaries
**Implementation**: Added comprehensive validation and error handling

**Changes Made**:

* Integrated `validateGeneratedSummary` function for AI output validation
* Added proper error handling for validation failures
* Implemented mock LLM for testing purposes
* Added validation for hallucinated places, sentiment consistency, and format requirements

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Async/Await Pattern Implementation

**Issue**: Converting synchronous methods to async operations
**Solution**: Updated all method signatures and call sites to use async/await

### 2. MongoDB Document Structure

**Issue**: Mismatch between expected and actual document structure
**Solution**: Updated all references to use MongoDB's `_id` field

### 3. LLM Mock Implementation

**Issue**: Creating a proper mock for the GeminiLLM interface
**Solution**: Implemented function augmentation with mock methods

### 4. Validation Testing

**Issue**: AI validation tests were too strict/brittle
**Solution**: Simplified validation tests to check for error presence rather than exact messages

## Testing Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage:

* **Operational Principle**: Create, update, delete logs with proper validation
* **Getters and Queries**: Test all query methods with various scenarios
* **AI Profile Summary**: Test LLM integration with validation
* **Error Handling**: Test all error conditions and edge cases
* **Data Integrity**: Test unique place tracking and average calculations

## Validation Features

The AI profile summary includes three levels of validation:

1. **Place Validation**: Ensures no hallucinated places are mentioned
2. **Sentiment Consistency**: Validates that sentiment matches average ratings
3. **Format Requirements**: Enforces length limits and proper punctuation
