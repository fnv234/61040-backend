## Test Coverage Analysis

### Operational Principle Tests

* **User Registration**: Tests user account creation with validation
* **Saved Places Management**: Tests adding, removing, and retrieving saved places
* **Preferences Management**: Tests updating and retrieving user preferences
* **User Isolation**: Tests that users maintain independent state

### Interesting Scenarios Tested

1. **Registration Validation**: Tests required field validation and duplicate prevention
2. **Duplicate Handling**: Tests that saving the same place twice doesn't create duplicates
3. **Error Handling**: Tests error conditions for non-existent users and places
4. **Preferences Updates**: Tests complete preferences replacement
5. **State Isolation**: Tests that users maintain independent saved places and preferences
6. **Edge Cases**: Tests scenarios with empty saved places and missing users

### Key Features Validated

* ✅ User registration with validation
* ✅ Duplicate user prevention
* ✅ Saved places management (add, remove, retrieve)
* ✅ Duplicate place prevention
* ✅ Preferences management
* ✅ User state isolation
* ✅ Error handling for non-existent users
* ✅ Database persistence and async operations
