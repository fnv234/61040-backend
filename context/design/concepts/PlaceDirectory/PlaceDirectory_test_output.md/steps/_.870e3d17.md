## Test Coverage Analysis

### Operational Principle Tests

* **Place Management**: Tests the core CRUD operations for place entries
* **Search and Filtering**: Tests location-based search, name search, and multi-criteria filtering
* **Data Retrieval**: Tests getting complete place information

### Interesting Scenarios Tested

1. **Validation Testing**: Tests required field validation (name and address)
2. **Partial Updates**: Tests updating only specific fields without affecting others
3. **Error Handling**: Tests error conditions for non-existent places
4. **Location Search**: Tests geospatial search with radius validation
5. **Name Search**: Tests case-insensitive name matching
6. **Multi-Criteria Filtering**: Tests filtering by price range, hours, and preparation styles
7. **Combined Filters**: Tests multiple filter criteria applied simultaneously
8. **Photos Handling**: Tests photo array storage and retrieval

### Key Features Validated

* ✅ Place creation with validation
* ✅ Place editing (full and partial updates)
* ✅ Place deletion
* ✅ Location-based search with radius
* ✅ Case-insensitive name search
* ✅ Multi-criteria filtering
* ✅ Photo array handling
* ✅ Error handling for non-existent places
* ✅ Database persistence and async operations
