# PlaceDirectory Concept Design Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to the PlaceDirectory concept during implementation and testing.

## Major Changes

Added edit\_place, delete\_place, and filter\_places to the PlaceDirectory concept, as suggested in assignment 2 feedback. Next, I go into detail about other changes:

### 1. Database Integration

**Original Design**: In-memory data structures
**Implementation**: MongoDB `Collection<Place>` with async operations

**Changes Made**:

* Converted to MongoDB collection-based storage
* Made all methods async to handle database operations
* Added proper error handling with `{error: string}` return types

### 2. Photos Field Implementation

**Original Design**: Optional photos field in place data
**Implementation**: Proper handling of photos array in create and edit operations

**Changes Made**:

* Added `photos?: URL[]` parameter to `create_place` method
* Updated `edit_place` to handle photos field updates
* Ensured photos array is properly stored and retrieved

### 3. Error Handling Standardization

**Original Design**: Mixed error handling approaches
**Implementation**: Consistent `{error: string}` return types for business logic errors

**Changes Made**:

* Standardized error returns for validation failures
* Maintained exception throwing for functional precondition violations (e.g., radius â‰¤ 0)
* Updated tests to handle both success and error return types

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Return Type Handling in Tests

**Issue**: Methods returning `PlaceId | {error: string}` caused TypeScript issues
**Solution**: Added proper type checking in tests to distinguish success from error cases

### 2. Database State Persistence

**Issue**: Test data persisting between test runs caused assertion failures
**Solution**: Added explicit database cleanup at the beginning of relevant test steps

### 3. Photos Field Testing

**Issue**: Photos field not being properly tested and validated
**Solution**: Added comprehensive testing for photos array creation, storage, and retrieval

## Testing Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage:

* **Place Creation**: Test successful creation and validation requirements
* **Place Editing**: Test partial updates and field-specific modifications
* **Place Deletion**: Test successful deletion and error handling
* **Location Search**: Test `find_nearby` with various radius values
* **Name Search**: Test case-insensitive name matching
* **Filtering**: Test filtering by price range, hours, and preparation styles
* **Details Retrieval**: Test getting complete place information

## Key Features

### 1. Flexible Place Management

* Support for optional fields (hours, photos)
* Partial updates without affecting other fields
* Comprehensive validation for required fields

### 2. Search and Filtering

* Location-based search with configurable radius
* Case-insensitive name search
* Multi-criteria filtering (price, hours, style)

### 3. Data Integrity

* Unique place identification
* Proper error handling for non-existent places
* Consistent data structure across all operations
