# concept: ExperienceLog

* **concept** ExperienceLog\[User, Place]

* **purpose**
  capture a user's personal experience at a place with structured ratings and notes,
  and enable AI-powered insights about their overall preferences and trends

* **principle**
  each log entry represents one user's assessment of one place at a specific time;
  users can track and reference their personal experiences;
  an AI model can generate summaries across a userâ€™s logs to highlight patterns
  such as preferred sweetness, strength, or favorite places

* **state**

  a set of Logs with
  a logId LogId
  a userId User
  a placeId Place
  a timestamp DateTime
  a rating Integer
  sweetness Integer
  strength Integer
  notes optional String
  photo optional String (URL)

* **actions**

  create\_log(userId: User, placeId: Place, rating: Integer, sweetness: Integer, strength: Integer): LogId
  **requires** rating is in the inclusive range \[1,5]
  **effects** adds new Log with new logId, given params, timestamp = now() to the set of Logs

  update\_log(logId: LogId, rating?: Integer, sweetness?: Integer, strength?: Integer, notes?: String, photo?: String)
  **requires** logId in {log.logId | log in the set of Logs} and if rating given then rating is in the inclusive range \[1,5]
  **effects** update log where log.logId = logId with non-null parameters

  delete\_log(logId: LogId)
  **requires** logId in {log.logId | log in Logs}
  **effects** Logs' = Logs - {log | log.logId = logId}

  get\_user\_logs(userId: User): set Log
  **effects** return {log | log in the set of Logs and log.userId = userId}

  get\_place\_logs(userId: User, placeId: Place): set Log
  **effects** return {log | log in the set of Logs and log.userId = userId and log.placeId = placeId}

  delete\_log(logId: LogId)
  **requires** logId in {log.logId | log in the set of Logs}
  **effects** updates the set of Logs such that: logs' = logs - {log | log.logId = logId}

  get\_average\_rating(userId: User, placeId: Place): Float
  **effects** return average of {log.rating | log in the set of Logs and log.userId = userId and log.placeId = placeId}

  get\_tried\_places(userId: User): set Place
  **effects** return {log.placeId | log in Logs and log.userId = userId}

  async generate\_profile\_summary(userId: User, llm: GeminiLLM): String
  **requires** there exists at least one log in the set of Logs with log.userId = userId
  **effects** calls llm with the user's Logs (ratings, sweetness, strength, notes, and places)
  and returns a concise textual summary describing the user's preferences and patterns
  **validators**
  \- summary must not mention places not in user's logs
  \- summary must be <= 3 sentences
  \- sentiment of summary should align with overall average rating

* notes
  This augmented version of ExperienceLog integrates an AI model (GeminiLLM)
  to synthesize multiple logs into a readable "taste profile."
  The summary helps users recognize long-term trends and preferences
  that might be difficult to notice from individual entries alone.

  Any parameters marked with a ? at the end are optional.
